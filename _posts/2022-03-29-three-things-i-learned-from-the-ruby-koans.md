title: Three things I learned from The Ruby Koans
---

Here are (at least) three things I learned from [The Ruby Koans](http://rubykoans.com/):

1. App Dev II will go a lot faster than the App Dev I!
2. Github Pages
3. Koans 
4. Some of the many tools we will learn/use include:
 - Markdown
 - Scrimba
 - Ruby 7
 - Ajax
 - Hotwire
 - React web
 - JSON API
 - JavaScript
 - React native
 - **and much more**
